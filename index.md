# Paradoxdruid's ESO Guides

*This is a work in progess; last updated 2025-05-30*

These represent Paradoxdruid's best attempt at capturing the mid-tier meta for U46 (groups who regularly do vet and vet HM content; not trifecta progs or scorepushing attempts).  

**Wait, you've got it all wrong!**  Yeah, maybe I do, that's totally fair.  And in any case, there's lots of good approaches and strategies, and not a one-size-fits-all approach that will always apply. See discussion of [Other Approaches](#other-approaches) towards the end of the document, to point out a few other common thoughts, and why I'm not currently recommending them for mid-tier groups.  

Thanks for all the feedback I've received to date!

# ESO Update 46 Mid-tier Build Guides

See [Guiding Principles](#guiding-principles) and [Buff Calculations](#buff-calculations) for explanations of set selections.

**Approach and Assumptions**

In this standard setup, we rely on most DPS being Arc/NB, and/or bringing Cro/Plar lines.  Because of this, Penetration and Crit Damage can be capped without some previously excellent support sets.  However, Minor Courage is difficult to source, so we put MT in Yolnakriin set.  Ultimate generation is also much easier with access to subclassing, so OT and both healers are focusing on spamming out ultimates as often as possible for high buff uptimes.

Please look at [Other Approaches](#other-approaches) for a few other possible meta setups and discussion.

# Notes

## Guiding Principles

* Most dps will be in meta Arc/NB combos, which feature high penetration and crit damage.  With Reaving Blows CP and/or Pragmatic Fatecarver, they have high innate survivability.
* Mid-tier players aren't perfect yet at stacking when needed, so effective use of slayer stacks is difficult.
* Due to meta classes being Arc/NB, there is no need for Roar of Alkosh, Elemental Catalyst, or Crimson Oath's Rive sets in most fights (see calculations below).
* With the changes to Zena's (targets 6, not smart targeting), sourcing Minor Courage requires a change.  Both healers in Healing Burst with Courage affix is possible, but again doesn't smart target.  All Banners in Courage works, but requires expensive Heroism potions.  Tank in Yolnakriin is the easiest source to reliably get everyone Minor Courage.  The recovery buffs from Zena's are moved to a healer running Radiant Aura.
* With changes to ult gen, pillager's profit is no longer worth it, but it's possible for healers to generate enough ult to spam low cost Barrier and Colossus ults almost on cooldown.

## Buff Calculations

* **Typical Meta Penetration (Arc/NB):**
  * Major Breach (Ele Sus) 5,948
  * Minor Breach (Cruxweaver on MT or good Brittle uptimes) 2,974
  * Crusher 2,108
  * Piercing Blue CP 700
  * (just a note, NB Master Assassin grants crit and not penetration now)
  * (Null Arca and Deadliy Strikes have no Pen lines)
  * Velothi: 1,650
  * Arcanist passives, 2 abilities slotted (Flail and Beam): 2,480
  * (optional: 1 Light Armor 939)
  * SUBTOTAL: 15,860; need 2,340 to reach cap
  * Tremorscale 2,640 (or Runic Sunder 2,200)
  * **TOTAL**: 18,500 (18,060 with sunder)
  * Overcap with no need for Kosh or Crimson

* **Typical Meta Crit Damage (Arc/NB):**
  * Base 50%
  * Minor Brittle 10%
  * Velothi / Minor Force 10%
  * 7 Medium armor 14% (optional: 6 pieces works, too)
  * Nightblade passive 10%
  * Arcanist passive 12%
  * Major Force (Horn and Sax) 20% 
  * **TOTAL**: 126%
  * (optional Lucent Echoes 11%, if bad Major Force uptimes)
  * Overcap with no need for EC

## Other Approaches

* One likely approach is putting DPS players in Courage Banner; this means the Tank doesn't need to run Yolna.  **Why I don't recommend:**
  *  In U46, there's less "must-have" tank sets, given the high crit damage and penetration.
  *  Minor Heroism is difficult to source--  the best options are Banner or Heroism pots, and most mid-tier groups can't afford to pop Heroism pots on cooldown and/or are bad at constantly chugging potions in general.
* What happened to ROJO?  **Why I don't recommend:**
  * First off, ROJO is still a great setup, and there's nothing wrong with it, per se.
  * But with the increased Ult generation available to healers, "spammable" ult sets and ults become more useful, allowing high uptimes just from ult generation.
  * ROJO's major weakness--  requiring HAs that slow down casting.  These lower ult gen from ult-generating spammables and reduce raw casts available.
* High-tier groups often run Berserk on the Banner.  They source other buffs; Savagery from potions and heroism from Torchbearer, for example.  **Why I don't recommend:**
  * For mid-tier groups, "fire and forget" buffs, such as always-on Camo Hunter lead to substantially higher uptimes and don't require as much player skill and coordination to achieve good results.
* Healers getting big Pillager ults has been the meta for a while.  **Why I don't recommend:**
  * With the increased Ult generation available to healers in U46, "spammable" ult sets and ults become more useful, allowing high uptimes just from ult generation.
  * Additionally, Pillagers was nerfed to 40% of it's former effectiveness, and the Pearls nerf reduces the ability to get those maximized pillager's ults.
  * However, it's still a unique buff, and I'm sure it will still see use.
* Why worry about Major Force?  Run Lucent Echoes and/or EC, have DPS players slot a spear ability, and you don't need Major Force at all.  **Why I don't recommend**:
  * With the increased Ult generation available to Off Tanks in U46, "spammable" ult sets and ults become more useful, allowing high uptimes just from ult generation.  An OT in Sax can have very high Major Force uptimes, especially if MT runs Horn as well.
  * Aggressive Horn remains a unique stat buff and is worthwhile even if major force is less required.
  * Focusing on buffs with previously low uptimes, like Major Berserk from Atronach, will lead to higher group DPS.
  * For mid-tier groups, we expect a range of preparedness and sets from players.  Reducing the need for EC, Lucent Echoes, etc makes the roster more accessible for less well geared-out players.

**Other meta setups, in brief:**

* All/most supports in Bone Tyrant (Necromancer) for high ult gen in trash.  Move Winter's Embrace / Frost Cloak onto a Healer.
* Running Courage on the Banner.  Tank drops Yolna.  Both Healers running Healing Burst with Anchorite's Potency for ult gen, and/or sourcing Minor Heroism from Heroism Potions.  Slayer Stacks become very important.  (Note that Soul Burst heals based on loading order into trial, so there's some shenanigans to optimize here).
