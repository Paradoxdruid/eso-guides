# Paradoxdruid's Quickstart Guides

_This is a work in progess; last updated 2025-11-23._

If you are just getting started on building a trial-ready character, these quickstart guides feature a bit more detail on some of the specifics that would be a good first step. You can see the full guides with much more details at [Paradoxdruid's ESO Guides: Builds and Rosters](./)

| • [Beam DPS Quickstart Guide](#eso-update-48-beam-dps-quickstart-guide) | I want to see how to build a Beam-based DPS that's trial-ready, including stats, mundus, food, race, skill bars, subclassing, and commonly worn armor sets to get up and running fast. **(Start here!)** |

**Wait, you've got it all wrong!** Yeah, maybe I do, that's totally fair. And in any case, there's lots of good approaches and strategies, and not a one-size-fits-all approach that will always apply. Thanks for all the feedback I've received to date!

# ESO Update 48 Beam DPS Quickstart Guide

## Easy U48 Beam Arcanist Guide

There's lots of ways to do good damage. But you want a cheatsheet on something effective, so you can get back to playing?

### The Basics

- **Race**: Dark Elf, Orc, Khajiit are the best races for DPS. Unsure? Pick Dark Elf.

- **Mundus**: ![thief mundus](./assets/icons/mundusstone-Thief.png){: class="inline-image"} [The Thief](<https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:The_Thief_(Mundus_Stone)>) provides important crit chance

- **Attributes**: 64 points in ![deni](./assets/icons/runestone-Deni.png){: class="inline-image"} **Stamina**<br>(damage is based off your highest stat, so you want all points in one category; high stamina is also important for trial mechanics that involve blocking, roll-dodging, or breaking free)

- **Food**: Max Stamina/Stamina Recovery/Health food (![dubious](./assets/icons/food-Dubious_Camoran_Throne.png){: class="inline-image"} [Dubious Camoran Throne](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Dubious_Camoran_Throne) or ![artaeum](./assets/icons/food-Brown_Chunky_Soup.png){: class="inline-image"} [Artaeum Takeaway Broth](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Artaeum_Takeaway_Broth)) is best for content. For parsing on the trial dummy, use Max Stamina/Stamina Recovery food (![lavafoot](./assets/icons/food-Lava_Foot_Soup-And-Saltrice.png){: class="inline-image"} [Lava Foot Soup and Saltrice](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Lava_Foot_Soup-and-Saltrice))

- **Subclassing**: Having useful skill lines from multiple classes greatly enhances your damage potential. Here, we'll use three all-around useful skill lines:
  - ![arcanist](./assets/icons/gp_class_arcanist.png){: class="inline-image"} Arcanist: Herald of the Tome
  - ![dk](./assets/icons/gp_class_dragonknight.png){: class="inline-image"} Dragonknight: Ardent Flame
  - ![nb](./assets/icons/gp_class_nightblade.png){: class="inline-image"} Nightblade: Assassination ( ![plar](./assets/icons/gp_class_templar.png){: class="inline-image"} Templar: Aedric Spear is good, too, and better for single-target fights)

### Gear

- The most versatile starting gear is:
  - 1 piece **Slimecraw** monster set (or any +crit chance monster piece). Usually in Light armor weight, for added penetration.
  - **Velothi Ur-Mage's Amulet**
  - 5 piece **Deadly Strike** (buy from guild traders or farm PvP) on the front bar (2 daggers)
  - 5 piece **Ansuul's Torment** on the body/rings
  - a **Maelstrom Inferno Staff** backbar (for single target-fights **Maelstrom Greatsword** )
  - (For purely single target fights, **Null Arca** with **Tide-Born Wildstalker** is stronger)
- At the beginning, craftable **Order's Wrath** or **Tide-Born Wildstalker** can replace Ansuul's Torment.
- Enchantments:
  - all body pieces Divine trait with +Stam glyphs
  - all jewelry Bloodthirsty with +Physical Harm glyphs
  - daggers Nirnhoned/Charged, one with Flame glyph one with Poison glyph. Nirnhoned/Precise is better in AoE-heavy fights.

### Skills

- Front-Bar:
  - Quick Cloak
  - Venomous Claw (or Killer's Blade, with Venomous Claw replacing Fulminating Rune backbar)
  - Cephaliarch's Flail
  - Pragmatic Fatecarver
  - Camo Hunter (not cast, slotted for passives) / can replace with Banner-Bearer
  - Incapacitating Strikes (or Crescent Sweep if using Aedric skill line)
- Backbar:
  - Inspired Scholarship
  - Elemental Blockade (or :Stampede: Stampede if using greatsword)
  - Flames of Oblivion
  - Fulminating Rune
  - Molten Whip (not cast, slotted for passives) / can replace with :Banner: Banner
  - Standard of Might or Languid Eye

### What to do

- Arcanists have long range and high cleave; always aim your beam to maximize targets hit. It also strikes targets immediately behind you, so you can press up against them and damage them as well ("butt beam")
- Always get to 3 crux before beaming. With Inspired Scholarship running, that means 2 casts of Flail, then beam. **Beam is over 50% of your damage. ABB. Always Be Beaming.**
- Your next highest sources of damage are Flames of Oblivion and Blockade of Fire, always keep them up.
- Arcanists cannot block-cast well; both Flail and Beam can't be block cast. In trial mechanics that require block casting, be mindful of this fact.
