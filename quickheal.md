## Healer Core Setup and Ideas

There's lots of ways to be a good healer. But you want a cheatsheet on something effective, so you can get back to playing?

- **Philosophy**: At the most basic, Healers in ESO have several core duties
  - **Healing**: Providing enough heals (both heal-over-time \[HoT\] and burst heals) to keep the group alive
  - **Buffs and Debuffs**: Keeping high uptimes of critical buffs and debuffs during the fight
  - **Provide Synergies and Set Effects**: Part of buffs and debuffs is using highly specified gear and skills to provide much needed synergies and set effects
  - **Mechanics**: Healers often are called on to do specific trial or dungeon mechanics that would kill a DPS, or keep them for applying consistent damage

### The Build Basics

- **Race**: Race isn't usually super impactful for Healers. Here's some good ones:
  - **Bretons** have high magicka recovery
  - **High** Elves have the highest base magicka
  - **Dark Elves** have a good amount of both Magicka and Stamina, which helps for trials with roll dodging, blocking, and other mechanics
  - **Argonians** gain additional benefit from the potions you;ll be chugging as a healer

- **Mundus**: There's a few that are useful.
  - ![atronach mundus](./assets/icons/mundusstone-Atronach.png){: class="inline-image"} [The Atronach](<https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:The_Atronach_(Mundus_Stone)>) provides extra Magicka recovery, which is great if you are casting at a high CPM (which you should be!).
  - ![ritual mundus](./assets/icons/mundusstone-Ritual.png){: class="inline-image"} [The Ritual](<https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:The_Ritual_(Mundus_Stone)>) provides extra healing. While big healing numbers can seem nice, it's usually mostly wasted as overhealing, and other choices are better.

- **Attributes**: 64 points in ![deni](./assets/icons/runestone-Makko.png){: class="inline-image"} **Magicka**<br>(healing is based off your highest stat, so you want all points in one category; high magicka also gives you the resource pool to spam your skill casts)

- **Food**:
  - ![clockwork](./assets/icons/food-Seafood_Skillet.png){: class="inline-image"} [Clockwork Citrus Filet](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Clockwork_Citrus_Filet): Max Magicka/Magicka Recovery/Health/Health Recovery food or (![brew](./assets/icons/food-Witchmother's_Potent_Brew.png){: class="inline-image"} [Witchmother's Potent Brew](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Dubious_Camoran_Throne) Max Magicka/Magicka Recovery/Health/Health Recovery food are often considered best
  - But if Max Health isn't an issue, ![ghastly](./assets/icons/food-Ghastly_Eye_Bowl.png){: class="inline-image"} [Ghastly Eye Bowl](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Ghastly_Eye_Bowl) Max Magicka/Magicka Recovery food is great, too.

- **Subclassing**: Having useful skill lines from multiple classes greatly enhances your ability to heal and the number of unique buffs and debuffs you can provide. The most critical are:
  - **Warden- Green Balance**: This skill line provides the entirely unique Minor Toughness buff (\_10% max health), and is needed in basically every trial group.
  - **Templar - Restoring Light**: This is skill provides an exceptionally strong and long-lasting HoT, strong burst heals, and the easiest way to apply the Minor Intellect & Endurance sustain buff to 12 members in a trial group.
  - **Nightblade- Siphoning**: This skill line provides the highest Ultimate generation of any skill line, as well as having great sustain and burst healing options.

**Disclaimer**: As always, the "right" abilities will depend on group composition (what skills the other tank and the healers are running), what content you are doing (mechanics, boss specific needs, are you going to need to chain things), and other factors. This is just a starting point!

## Green Balance Healer Build

**Note**: Just by having the Green Balance class line (specifically the maturation passive), all of your healing applies Minor Toughness to allies, an important and unique +10% max health buff.

| ![illustrious](./assets/icons/ability_restorationstaff_004b.png)    | **Illustrious Healing**                                        | This is one of your primary ground heal over time (HoT) spells; it should always be up for the group. It smart targets, unlike the other morph.                                                                                                                  |
| ![budding seeds](./assets/icons/ability_warden_007_b.png)           | **Budding Seeds**                                              | This is your other primary ground HoT. This also provides a good healing synergy. Often, you will keep this ability focused on the MT, so they have a synergy available to restore resources.                                                                    |
| ![combat prayer](./assets/icons/ability_restorationstaff_003_b.png) | **Combat Prayer**                                              | Your main healing spammable and probably most-cast ability. It heals everyone in a large rectangle in front of you, as well as providing Minor Resolve (~3% damage reduction) and Minor Berserk (5% damage increase). If in doubt, spam this during heal checks. |
| ![warding burst](./assets/icons/ability_grimoire_soulmagic2.png)    | **Warding Burst**                                              | This provides a useful damage shield for HoTs to heal the group under, and with _Anchorite's Potency_ gives you and the group ultimate generation.                                                                                                               |

|                                                                     | ![contingency](./assets/icons/ability_grimoire_magesguild.png) | **Warding Contingency**: With Damage Shield and Growing Impact, this skill can give groupwide Minor Protection (5% damage reduction) or Minor Mag & Stam recovery, if a healer with Restoring Light isn't providing it.                                          |
|                                                                     | ![offering](./assets/icons/ability_nightblade_011_a.png)       | **Healthy Offering**: This is a strong heal for single-target heal checks like Tombs, and will generate ultimate from passives.                                                                                                                                  |
|                                                                     | ![altar](./assets/icons/ability_undaunted_001_a.png)           | **Overflowing Altar**: One healer should always be running this strong heal and provider of massive heal synergy, preferably near the Tank.                                                                                                                      |
| ![soul siphon](./assets/icons/ability_nightblade_018_b.png)         | Ultimate: **Soul Siphon**                                      | This serves two purposes. Passively slotted, it gives you +6% Mag and Stam, +3% self-healing. Second, it's a good "oh shit" button if you or especially the group is taking too much damage, to buy some breathing room.                                         |

| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![orb](./assets/icons/ability_undaunted_004b.png)              | **Energy Orb**                     | A very strong HoT and source of an essential recovery synergy. It should always be up and active, usually aimed and near to tanks. (can switch with flex spot FB)                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ![blockade](./assets/icons/ability_destructionstaff_003_b.png) | **Blockade of Lightning**          | This is an important debuff skill. It sets concussed enemies (sourced from Tank's Ele Sus) off balance, and procs the Crusher or Weakening enchantment on your BB staff. Skill can be dropped sometimes, if you have a DPS with off-balance Knife skill, or just need barspace for Altar or situational skills.                              |
| ![vigor](./assets/icons/ability_ava_echoing_vigor.png)         | **Echoing Vigor**                  | A very strong sticky HoT (so good to cast before dps run off to do mechanics) that is Stamina based, to help manage resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ![chakram](./assets/icons/ability_arcanist_015_a.png)          | **Chakram of Destiny**             | A good spammable shield skill. It also generates Crux, which increases all your healing by up to 12%. (can switch with flex spot FB)                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ![siphoning](./assets/icons/ability_nightblade_003_b.png)      | **Siphoning Attacks**              | A passive skill that keeps up the +6% Mag & Stam when you bar swap, and any damage you deal (like, constantly from Blockade) heals you and restores resources. Can also be cast to restore resources when low.                                                                                                                               |
| ![glyphic](./assets/icons/ability_arcanist_018_a.png)          | Ultimate: **Glyphic of the Tides** | One of the strongest HoT effects in the game, and importantly it ticks every 1 second, when many heals tick every 2 seconds. Great for heal checks like vKA Falgravn HM 3rd floor. It also boosts group damage more than Pearlescent Ward or Xoryn's set effects; worth casting anytime group is fighting even if they don't need the heals. |

### Situational Healer Skills

| Icon                                                          | Name                             | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![barrier](./assets/icons/ability_ava_006_b.png)              | **Reviving Barrier** BB ultimate | This serves two purposes. First, it passively gives +10% Magicka recovery. Second, it is a very strong shield and HoT for heavy damage moments, and is very useful for groupwide damage checks.   |
| ![thicket](./assets/icons/ability_warden_012_b.png)           | **Healing Thicket**              | A strong extra HoT. Importantly, it's very cheap to cast, so if you need spammable extra healing, like vSE Ansuul HM, it's worth considering.                                                     |
| ![zenas](./assets/icons/ability_arcanist_017_a.png)           | **Zenas' Empowering Disc**       | Minor Courage and Mag & Stam recovery is very nice, but only hits six targets. Useful for dungeons or trials with split Bosses like vLC Garg/Scorp.                                               |
| ![purge](./assets/icons/ability_ava_005_b.png)                | **Efficient Purge**              | Purges harmful effects which can make some fights easier, such as in the first boss in vHoF. Many effects you would expect to be purgable in other trials... aren't.                              |
| ![ele sus](./assets/icons/ability_destructionstaff_011b.png)  | **Elemental Susceptibility**     | For some trials, healers will need to slot this to debuff side adds, such as Protectors in vAS+2. Applies Major Breach, and will proc Off-Balance if your Blockade of Lightning is on the target. |
| ![leashing soul](./assets/icons/ability_otherclass_003_a.png) | **Leashing Soul**                | Sometimes healers need to taunt; using a Pull skill allows you to taunt without fear of stealing taunt from the Boss and you can apply Major Cowardice or Major Maim to reduce enemy damage.      |
| ![trample](./assets/icons/ability_grimoire_assault.png)       | **Trample**                      | An alternative source of Major Heroism instead of the Pearls of Ehlnofey Mythic.                                                                                                                  |
| ![guard](./assets/icons/ability_ava_mystic_guard.png)         | **Mystic Guard**                 | Powerful damage reduction for a Tank, used in certain boss fights, like vDSR Twins HM.                                                                                                            |

## Restoring Light Healer Build

**Disclaimer**: As always, the "right" abilities will depend on group composition (what skills the other tank and the healers are running), what content you are doing (mechanics, boss specific needs, are you going to need to chain things), and other factors. This is just a starting point!

It smart targets, unlike the other morph.                                                                                                                  |

Extremely strong and long-lasting, and also provides a group-wide synergy for resource recovery.                                                                                                                                  |

It heals everyone in a large rectangle in front of you, as well as providing Minor Resolve (~3% damage reduction) and Minor Berserk (5% damage increase). If in doubt, spam this during heal checks. |
| ![warding burst](./assets/icons/ability_grimoire_soulmagic2.png)    | **Warding Burst**                                              | This provides a useful damage shield for HoTs to heal the group under, and with _Anchorite's Potency_ gives you and the group ultimate generation.                                                                                                               |

|                                                                     | ![offering](./assets/icons/ability_nightblade_011_a.png)       | **Healthy Offering**: This is a strong heal for single-target heal checks like Tombs, and will generate ultimate from passives.                                                                                                                                  |

Passively slotted, it gives you +6% Mag and Stam, +3% self-healing. Second, it's a good "oh shit" button if you or especially the group is taking too much damage, to buy some breathing room.                                         |

| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![orb](./assets/icons/ability_undaunted_004b.png)                | **Energy Orb**                 | A very strong HoT and source of an essential recovery synergy. It should always be up and active, usually aimed and near to tanks. (can switch with flex spot FB)                                                                                                                                                   |
| ![blockade](./assets/icons/ability_destructionstaff_003_b.png)   | **Blockade of Lightning**      | This is an important debuff skill. It sets enemies Concussed (to get off-balance with Tank's Ele Sus cast), and procs the Crusher or Weakening enchantment on your BB staff. Skill can be dropped sometimes, if you have a DPS with off-balance Knife skill, or just need barspace for Altar or situational skills. |
| ![vigor](./assets/icons/ability_ava_echoing_vigor.png)           | **Echoing Vigor**              | A very strong sticky HoT (so good to cast before dps run off to do mechanics) that is Stamina based, to help manage resources.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![radiant](./assets/icons/ability_templar_life_giving_sigil.png) | **Radiant Aura**               | A super-long lasting buff that provides important Minor Mag & Stam recovery for the group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![siphoning](./assets/icons/ability_nightblade_003_b.png)        | **Siphoning Attacks**          | A passive skill that keeps up the +6% Mag & Stam when you bar swap, and any damage you deal (like, constantly from Blockade) heals you and restores resources. Can also be cast to restore resources when low.                                                                                                      |
| ![barrier](./assets/icons/ability_ava_006_b.png)                 | Ultimate: **Reviving Barrier** | This serves two purposes. First, it passively gives +10% Magicka recovery. Second, it is a very strong shield and HoT for heavy damage moments, and is very useful for group-wide damage checks.                                                                                                                    |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![atronach](./assets/icons/ability_sorcerer_endless_atronachs.png) | Ultimate: **Summon Charged Atronach** | A powerful ult that also provides a synergy to give groupwide Major Berserk (+10% damage).                                                                                                        |
| ![zenas](./assets/icons/ability_arcanist_017_a.png)                | **Zena's Empowering Disc**            | Minor Courage and Mag & Stam recovery is very nice, but only hits six targets. Useful for dungeons or trials with split Bosses like vLC Garg/Scorp.                                               |
| ![purge](./assets/icons/ability_ava_005_b.png)                     | **Efficient Purge**                   | A few trials require this skill to purge harmful effects, notably vHoF. Many effects you would expect to be purgable in other trials... aren't.                                                   |
| ![ele sus](./assets/icons/ability_destructionstaff_011b.png)       | **Elemental Susceptibility**          | For some trials, healers will need to slot this to debuff side adds, such as Protectors in vAS+2. Applies Major Breach, and will proc Off-Balance if your Blockade of Lightning is on the target. |
| ![leashing soul](./assets/icons/ability_otherclass_003_a.png)      | **Leashing Soul**                     | Sometimes healers need to taunt; using a Pull skill allows you to taunt without fear of stealing taunt from the Boss and you can apply Major Cowardice or Major Maim to reduce enemy damage.      |
| ![trample](./assets/icons/ability_grimoire_assault.png)            | **Trample**                           | An alternative source of Major Heroism instead of the Pearls of Ehlnofey Mythic.                                                                                                                  |
| ![guard](./assets/icons/ability_ava_mystic_guard.png)              | **Mystic Guard**                      | Powerful damage reduction for a Tank, used in certain boss fights, like vDSR Twins HM.                                                                                                            |
