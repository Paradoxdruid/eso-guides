_This is a work in progess; last updated 2026-02-01._

These capture the mid-tier meta for Update 49 (U49), aimed at groups who regularly do vet and vet HM content; venturing in trifecta progs. **Wait, you've got it all wrong!** Yeah, maybe I do, that's totally fair. And in any case, there's lots of good approaches and strategies, and not a one-size-fits-all approach that will always apply. Thanks for all the feedback I've received to date!

# Notes

## Guiding Principles

- Most dps will be in meta Herald of the Tome/Assassination combos, which feature high penetration and crit damage. With Pragmatic Fatecarver and/or Reaving Blows CP, they have high innate survivability.
- Due to meta classes being Arc/NB, there is limited need for Roar of Alkosh or Crimson Oath's Rive sets in most fights (see calculations below).
- With the changes to Zenas' (targets 6, not smart targeting), sourcing Minor Courage requires a change. The primary method of achieving this is through the courage affix on two Banner Bearer DPS. The recovery buffs from Zenas' are moved to a healer running Radiant Aura.

## Buff Calculations

- **Typical Meta Penetration (Arc/NB/Aedric):**
  - Major Breach (Ele Sus) 5,949
  - Minor Breach (Cruxweaver on MT or good Wall/Ele Sus uptimes) 2,974
  - Crusher 2,108
  - Piercing Blue CP 700
  - (note than common Null Arca and Deadliy Strikes sets have no Pen lines)
  - Velothi: 1,650
  - Arcanist passives, 2 abilities slotted (Flail and Beam): 2,490
  - 1 Light Armor 939
  - Either:
    - Set with Penetration line (Ansuuls or Tideborn) 1,497
    - 1-piece Monster set with penetration (Valkyn Skoria) 1,497
    - Tank running Runic Sunder as Taunt 2,200
  - **TOTAL**: 18,307 (pen line set) or 19,010 (runic sunder taunt)
  - Over the penetration cap with no need for Kosh or Crimson

- **Typical Meta Crit Damage (Arc/NB):**
  - Base 50%
  - Minor Brittle 10%
  - Velothi / Minor Force 10%
  - 6 Medium armor 12%
  - Nightblade passive 10%
  - Arcanist passive 12%
  - Lucent Echoes 11%
  - Either:
    - Major Force (Saxhleel Champion, Aggressive Horn, or both) 20%
    - Elemental Catalyst 15%
  - **TOTAL**: 135% or 130%
  - Over the crit damage cap

## Other Approaches

- A common composition is to put minor heroism on banner and source minor courage from the Yolnahkriin set. **Why I don't recommend:**
  - Minor heroism is a luxury buff that can be sourced through potions. It is not a requirement, nor is it overly impactful. The buff itself provides 40 ultimate every 60 seconds.
  - We give up a 5 piece slot on a tank that could be used to source another more impactful buff such as Major Force from Saxhleel Champion, 307 Weapon Damage from Powerful Assault or 180 Weapon Damage from Pearlescent Ward.
  - Most fights in trials and dungeons are burst or phased fights. A set that provides a contant minor buff is less impactful and important than one which provides a stronger buff for a short time.
  - If we decide to give up a set like Saxhleel we need to change other parts of our build as well as the builds of others to compensate.
    - DPS have to change their CP, for example by dropping Wrathful Strikes (205 Weapon Damage) for Fighting Finesse (8% Critical Damage).
  - Using Yolnahkriin is always a damage loss, and the expected value loss in certain circumstances is huge.
  <details>
    <summary>Explanation and Calculations: (click to expand)
    <ul>
      <li>The ultimate generation of minor heroism increases DPS by approximately 4.5/60 * 14% = 1.05%
        <ul>
          <li>The ultimate generation from minor heroism provides approximately (40/70) * 8s = 4.5s of 20% bonus damage from Incap every 60 seconds.</li>
          <li>This is diluted down to ~14% bonus damage done due to other buffs which are always active such as minor berserk and our CPs (and even further with temporary buffs such as Major Berserk).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The DPS gain from keeping our wrathful strikes CP and using Saxhleel to reach crit cap in the important burst phases is ~2.5%.
        <ul>
          <li>When we don't have the Major Force from Saxhleel, our damage is only ~0.67% worse at 115% crit damage.</li>
          <li>We can calculate the expected value (whether this is worth it) with this formula: E(T) = (1-T) * -0.67% + T * 2.5% where T is the uptime of Major Force.</li>
          <li>The absolute minimum uptime is 20%, because we generate 3 ultimate per second from light attacking, however our class passives, skills (such as Trample and Exhilarating Drain) and the decisive trait can increase this.
            <ul>
              <li>If we take a conservative ultimate generation per second value of 4, our expected value from using Saxhleel is (1-0.267) * -0.67% + 0.267 * 2.5% = 0.18%, which only goes up the more you and your group improves.</li>
              <li>The absolute minimum uptime of 20% is only a (1-0.2%) * -0.67 + 0.2% * 2.5 = -0.036% damage loss, which is almost negligible and highlights how pointless it is to use Yoln.</li>
              <li>This minimum uptime also doesn't account for being able to start a fight phase with some ultimate already which can dramatically increase the uptime of Major Force.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
