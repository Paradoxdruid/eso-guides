These guides represent Paradoxdruid's best attempt at capturing the mid-tier meta for Update 48 for trial-ready groups and players of the online MMORPG [Elder Scrolls Online](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/home) (aimed at groups who regularly do vet and vet hard-mode content; not trifecta progression groups or scorepushing attempts).

I hope you find them useful, and welcome contributions, whether in the form of pull requests, [Discord DMs](https://discordapp.com/users/drparadoxdruid), or email.
